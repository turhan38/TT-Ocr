##  Overview

Here is a compelling overview of the project:

"Unlock the power of written text recognition with TTranslate! This innovative project uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to capture and process text from any focused window, then displays the recognized text in intuitive rectangles on your screen. Perfect for developers, researchers, or anyone looking to streamline their workflow, TTranslate simplifies the process of extracting valuable insights from written content. Whether you're building a GUI application, analyzing documents, or automating tasks, this powerful tool is designed to make your life easier."

				<td>- Here is a succinct summary of the main purpose and use of the provided code file:

**Summary:** The code file captures text from a focused window using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and processes it to identify and match written text<br>- It then writes matched text into rectangles on the screen, updating a list of written text.

**Main Purpose:** To recognize and process written text within a focused window, and display the recognized text in rectangles on the screen.

**Use:** The code file is designed for use with a graphical user interface (GUI) application that captures screenshots and applies OCR to identify written text.</td>
